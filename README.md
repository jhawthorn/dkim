dkim
====

A DKIM signing library in ruby.

Installation
============

    sudo gem install dkim

Usage
=====

Calling `Dkim.sign` on a string representing an email message returns the message with a DKIM signature inserted.

For example

    mail = <<eos
    To: someone@example.com
    From: john@example.com
    Subject: hi
    
    Howdy
    eos

    Dkim.sign(mail)

    # =>
    # To: someone@example.com
    # From: john@example.com
    # Subject: hi
    # DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=example.com; q=dns/txt; s=mail; t=1305917829;
    #  	bh=qZxwTnSM1ywsrq0Ag9UhQSOtVIG+sW5zDkB+hPbuX08=; h=from:subject:to;
    #  	b=0mKnNOkxFGiww63Zu4t46J7eZc3Uak3I9km3IH2Le3XcnSNtWJgxiwBX26IZ5yzcT
    # 	VwJzcCnPKCScIJMQ7yfbfXmNsKVIOV6eSUqu1YvJ1fgzlSAXuDEMNFTjoto5rrdA+
    # 	BgX849hEY/bWHDl1JJgNpiwtpl4t0Q7M4BVJUd7Lo=
    # 
    # Howdy

Necessary configuration
-----------------------
A private key, a domain, and a selector need to be specified in order to sign messages.

These can be specified globally

    Dkim::domain      = 'example.com'
    Dkim::selector    = 'mail'
    Dkim::private_key = open('private.pem').read

Options can be overridden per message.

    Dkim.sign(mail, :selector => 'mail2', :private_key => open('private2.pem').read)

Additional configuration
------------------------

The following is the default configuration

    Dkim::signable_headers        = Dkim::DefaultHeaders # Sign only the specified headers
    Dkim::signing_algorithm       = 'rsa-sha256' # can be rsa-sha1 or rsa-sha256 (default)
    Dkim::header_canonicalization = 'relaxed'    # Can be simple or relaxed (default)
    Dkim::body_canonicalization   = 'relaxed'    # Can be simple or relaxed (default)

The defaults should fit most users needs; however, certain use cases will need them to be customized.

For example, for sending mesages through amazon SES, certain headers should not be signed

    Dkim::signable_headers = Dkim::DefaultHeaders - %w{Message-ID Resent-Message-ID Date Return-Path Bounces-To}

rfc4871 states that signers SHOULD sign using rsa-sha256. For this reason, dkim will *not* use rsa-sha1 as a fallback if the openssl library does not support sha256.
If you wish to override this behaviour and use whichever algorithm is available you can use this snippet (**not recommended**).

    Dkim::signing_algorithm = defined?(OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256) ? 'rsa-sha256' : 'rsa-sha1'

Usage With Rails
================

Dkim contains `Dkim::Interceptor` which can be used to sign all mail delivered by the [mail gem](https://github.com/mikel/mail) or rails 3, which uses mail.
For rails, create an initializer (for example `config/initializers/dkim.rb`) with the following template.

    # Configure dkim globally (see above)
    Dkim::domain      = 'example.com'
    Dkim::selector    = 'mail'
    Dkim::private_key = open('private.pem').read

    # This will sign all ActionMailer deliveries
    ActionMailer::Base.register_interceptor('Dkim::Interceptor')

Example executable
==================

The library includes a `dkimsign.rb` executable suitable for testing the library or performing simple signatures.

`dkimsign.rb DOMAIN SELECTOR KEYFILE [MAILFILE]`

If MAILFILE is not specified `dkimsign.rb` will read the mail message from standard in.

Limitations
===========

* Strictly a DKIM signing library. No support for signature verification. *(none planned)*
* No support for the older Yahoo! DomainKeys standard ([RFC 4870](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4870)) *(none planned)*
* No support for specifying DKIM identity `i=` *(planned)*
* No support for body length `l=` *(planned)*
* No support for signature expiration `x=` *(planned)*
* No support for copied header fields `z=` *(not immediately planned)*

Resources
=========

* [RFC 4871](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871)
* Inspired by perl's [Mail-DKIM](http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net/)
